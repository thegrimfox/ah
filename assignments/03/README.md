# Assignment #3

## Instructions

This week assignment is a script that get and process information from a json file (prize.json)

Complete the required methods.

Additionally,

- Must be well documented
- Just fill the space assigned to code in the file assignment.py
- Pass flake8 test

After the code is ready to be sent, add your assignment to your course repository in GitHub, and send the link to me (cristhian.aguilera@ulagos.cl). Your repository must have the following structure

- Assignments
  - 03
  - ..

## Tips

- Asume always the same name of the json file. Hardcoded
- Read carefully the description of each method
- Explore the json first
- Explore how to work with a json in python
- Check the code
- Load the json in each method!. I know it is inefficient
